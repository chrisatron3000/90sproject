                The day the world will end, no doubt, has been a topic of concern in many people's minds. There is no doubt that at least you or someone around you has thought about this age-old question. The answer can be found within a collaboration between NASA, a governmental space agency, and Toho University in Sendai, Japan. Together, they made a supercomputer strong enough to perform calculations to make the closest approximation to when the world will definitely end. The answer may not be what the media depicts of the final days of Earth.
	            First, Most shows, movies, videos, or any form of entertainment, etc. All depict the Earth going out with a bang, whether it be devastating off-the-charts natural disasters that wipe the world to a clean slate, an invasion of extraterrestrial beings, or even mass disease that runs rampant and forces humanity back into survival mode. All these interesting depictions from many creative minds throughout the years have their own version of the final day of the calendar. As expected, fiction falls way away from reality. From NASA and Tohu University Supercomputer. The definitive end of the world will actually happen due to the sun rapidly evolving and getting hotter, so hot that the temperature of Earth approximate to the sun would approximate the temperature of Mercury. How rapid, you ask? In about 1,000,002,021 years, the world will become uninhabitable and all life will not be able to continue to exist on the Earth's surface.
	            All that's pretty crazy, and all things considered. You probably won't be alive for the end of the world, but the reassurance is that it won't happen for quite a few millennials.
